# SSHWebClient - Pineapple Module
Simple SSH Web Client Module for your WiFi Pineapple!

# This is a fork of the original developers work, it's also in development.
I made this because the original developer contacted me and reported some issues with the project.
I've uploaded my correct process on the module, so people can take a look at it before it's complete.
There are known issues at the moment, but it's being worked on and should be fixed shortly.

# todo:
- Fix the interface stuff, or make it always use the correct ip-address in the iframes.
- Look into a security issue that might exist because of iframes.
- Create a toggle for enabling/disabling the shellinaboxd service at boot-time.
- Look into ptroblems reported when using this on either nano or tetra.

# Thanks to:
<strong>Ei8htbits</strong> for initially creating the module, and coming up with the id√®a of this module.
